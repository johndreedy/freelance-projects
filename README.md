# freelance-projects

A repository to demonstrate personal projects I have been developing to make use of what I have learnt in my software and web development courses. Currently I am working on Nexus EZ File Finder, a web scraping algorithm written in JavaScript to find the files of deleted mod pages on Nexus Mods, still present on their servers.
